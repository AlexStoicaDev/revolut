## Business requirements

    • Refresh the rate every 10s (we do not expect the rate to change every 10s as most free rate sources won't provide live rates).
    • Contain at least three currency accounts with USD, EUR, GBP.
    • Make it possible to make an exchange between accounts.
    • Contain two inputs on the exchange screen for both accounts. Each input should be validated to let the user type only numbers with two digits after the dot.
    • Give all the necessary information: exchange rate between active accounts and account balances.
